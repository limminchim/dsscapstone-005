## Prompt:
The goal of this task is to write a report that can be used as the basis for a final product or perhaps a submission to the Yelp dataset challenge. In addition, you need to create a 5-slide deck using RStudio Presenter tools to describe and promote your analysis. 

## Report
Write a 5-page report using R Markdown that describes your question/problem, how you used the dataset, the analysis you conducted, and the conclusions that you drew from the analysis. Your report must have the following sections clearly labelled:

1. Title - A brief description of what you've done
2. Introduction - A description of the question/problem and the rationale for studying it
3. Methods and Data - Describe how you used the data and the type of analytic methods that you used; it's okay to be a bit technical here but clarity is important
4. Results - Describe what you found through your analysis of the data.
5. Discussion - Explain how you interpret the results of your analysis and what the implications are for your question/problem.


## Slide Deck
Write 5 slides using [RStudio Presenter](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations) that summarizes your report for a general audience. Explain what the problem you presented is interesting and how your analysis directly addresses that problem.
